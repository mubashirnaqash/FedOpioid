# ðŸš€ Opioid Dependence Classification in Federated Learning Setup ðŸš€

Welcome to our cutting-edge project, where we tackle the classification of opioid dependence using a federated learning setup. This repository contains a suite of Python scripts designed to preprocess data, build classification models, and demonstrate a federated learning approach, all while considering the utmost respect for data privacy.

## Data Source

The dataset used in this project is sourced from the MIMIC (Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care) database. Due to privacy concerns and usage agreements associated with the MIMIC dataset, the data cannot be shared openly. Users looking to replicate or extend this work must obtain access to the MIMIC dataset independently, adhering to all applicable usage and privacy guidelines.

## Features

- ðŸ“Š **Data Preprocessing**: Utilize our preprocessing script to clean and prepare your dataset, ensuring it's primed for accurate classification.
- ðŸ§  **Model Building**: Employ our model script to construct and train a machine learning model dedicated to predicting opioid dependence.
- ðŸ”— **Federated Learning**: Explore how our client and server scripts interact in a federated learning environment, enhancing privacy and decentralization.
- ðŸ“ˆ **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Understand your dataset better with our exploratory analysis, gaining valuable insights to inform your modeling.
